# Like most Linux configuration files, this specifies a set of user controller
# parameters.  In many cases these are commented out which simply means those
# are the default values already used by collectl.  To change a value
# uncomment the line and change it.  To revert back to the default all you 
# need do is recomment the line.

# daemon/service handling
############################

# When someone specifies a daemon is to be run, typically but not limited
# to running collectl as a service, this string will cause the associated
# values to be used.  They CAN also be overriden via a command line switch.
# In other words, if DaemonCommands is set to '-s cdm' and collectl is 
# envoked with -D, it will process subsystems 'cdm'.  However, if it is envoked
# with '-D -s mnp' it will process subsystems 'mnp', there is no combining the
# two set of values.  Be sure to include any switches a daemon is required to 
# have such as -f and either -r or -R.
# NOTE - if things aren't behaving as expected, you can always try running
# collectl in non-daemon mode just to see if there are any error messages.  If
# you include the -m switch, you can also look in the collectl log, which is 
# stored in the logging directory.

# Collectl will assume open fabric and will attempt to use the perfquery 
# utility to get the counters.  If not there, it assumes Voltaire and will
# first look in /proc/voltaire/adaptor-mlx/stats and failing that will use
# the get_pcounter utiliy.  Since collectl resets IB counters in the
# hardware you can disable its collection by commenting out the appropriate

# VStat for ALL non-ofed access of any kind.

# Collectl will automatically size the frequency of headers in 'brief format'
