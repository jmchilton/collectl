collectl only runs in playback mode on windows so you
will have to copy over one or more raw files to use it.
You will also have to have perl installed.

To Install
- unpack src tarball, which can be done by most utilitis, into a 
  temporary directory
- create a directory to install collectl into, say \collectl
- copy the following files into \collectl
  - collectl
  - collectl.conf
  - *ph

You're done!  To verify the installation run

\collectl\collectl.pl -v
