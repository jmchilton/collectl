<center><h1>High Resolution Timer Warnings</h1></center>
<p>
There has been a recent problem identified when running collectl on systems
with versions of the <i>Time:HiRes</i> perl module less than 1.91 and versions
of <i>glibc</i> newer then 2.3.  So far these messages appear to be harmless as
they've only been identified as occurring during system boot.  However, since the
problem is that <i>HiRes</i> is actually calling the <i>setitimer</i> system
service incorrectly, it is really living on borrowed time (if you'll pardon the
pun) and users would be much better off and safer to simply upgrade to a newer
version which they can get at http://search.cpan.org/dist/Time-HiRes/.
<p>
If you've never installed something from CPAN before you shouldn't be intimidated
even if you're not a programmer as all you need to do is perform the following
steps.  If the version you're downloading is not 1.9715, replace that string
in the instructions below with the appropriate version number:
<ul>
<li>download Time-HiRes-1.9715.tar.gz to /tmp</li>
<li>cd /tmp</li>
<li>unpack it with the command <i>tar -zxf Time-HiRes-1.9715.tar.gz</i></li>
<li>cd Time-HiRes-1.9715</li>
<li>perl Makefile.PL</li>
<li>make</li>
<li>make test</li>
<li>make install</li>
<li>collectl -v should identify the newer version</li>
</ul>
<p>
In a few cases, rather than replacing the older version the new one ends up in a
different location, and collectl still sees the old version.  You can usually get
around this problem by re-executing the <i>make install</i> command as <i>make 
install -UNINST=1</i>

<b>Update - April 08, 2009</b>
<br>It looks like RedHat has finally responded to my bugzilla and posted a
<a href=http://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2009-0406.html>solution</a>, which makes
me optimistic we should see a newer version of <i>Time::HiRes</i> in the RHEL5.4 timeframe.
That still doesn't mean the problem has been resolved on distros that use older versions.
