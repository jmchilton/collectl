<center><h1>Disk Monitoring</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

As with other subsystems that have specific devices, collectl can report disk summary as well as detail data.
Like other summary data, disk summary data represents the total activity across all disks or to be more precise, those
enumerated in /proc/diskstats, with a couple of caveats:
<ul>
<li>Partition data is skipped</li>
<li>Only those disk names that explicitly match the pattern in DiskFilter (see collectl.conf) are included. But don't
worry, <i>all</i> major types of disks are included as well as several others as they are identified.</li>
<li>Device mapper disks, while listed in the detail data are <i>NOT</i> included in the summary data to avoid
double counting</li> 
</ul>

The three key counters for disk activity are bytes, iops and merges, though only bytes and iops are reported
in brief summary mode.  The average I/O size which is also reportd in verbose and detail modes may be optionally 
included in brief mode by including --iosize or --dskopts i.  If you're not sure why/when you'd care about summary
data, be sure to read <a href=WhySummary.html>this</a>.
<p>
Disk detail goes a step further and in addition to including the same information that's reported for summary data
also includes key device specific metrics relating to queue lengths, wait and service times as well as utilization.
For those familiar with iostat, this is the same data it reports.  These numbers will help you determine if your
individual disks are operating properly since high wait and/or service times are a bad thing and indicate something
is causing an undesired delay somewhere.

<p><b>Filtering</b>
<br>If you'd like to limit the disks included in either the detail output or the summary
totals, you can explicity include or exclude them using <i>--dskfilt</i>.  The target of
this switch is actually one or more perl expressions, but if you don't know perl all you
really need to know is these are strings that are compared to each disk name.  If the first
(or only) name is preceded with a ^, disks that match the string(s) will be excluded.
