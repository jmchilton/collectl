<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Included with collectl is the example file <i>hello.ph</i> which is a collectlized version of
hello world.  It simulates a <i>hw</i> subsystem consisting of 3 hw instances, which in turn
report a single counter.  Here is an example of its simulated /proc data, which is shown by
using -d4.  Also notice in this case the discriminator is <i>hw</i> but <i>-n</i> is also
included in the calls to <i>record()</i> to further identify individual devices:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --imp hello -d4
>>> 1238167880.003 <<<
hw-0 HelloWorld 0
hw-1 HelloWorld 10
hw-2 HelloWorld 40
</pre></div>

You can use this example module with virtually any combinations of switches and any other collectl
subsystems as well as exporting the output over a socket, writing to a raw file or playing it back.
As you should realize by now the combinations are far too extensive to list so below is only the
simplest one, showing this data combined with cpu stats in brief format with timestamps in msecs.
<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl --imp hello -sc -oTm
#             <--------CPU--------><-Hello->
#Time         cpu sys inter  ctxsw   Total
11:40:29.002    0   0  1027    126     140
11:40:30.002    0   0  1012    138     230
</pre></div>

For further information on using this capability see hello.ph which has been heavily annotated and
should make a good staring template for developing your own custom modules.
