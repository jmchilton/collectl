<center><h1>Exception Reporting</h1></center>
<p>
By default, collectl always reports all data for all devices.  However, in the
cases where there are dozens or possibly hundreds of devices such as with large
disk farms, it may be desirable to only look at those devices that are actually
doing something of interest.  These are referred to as exceptions, because
their activity has crossed a level of minimal activity.  The defaults for these levels
can be displayed with the -V switch or
changed to different values with the -l switch.  To change one or more values
simply specify them as a string.  There are currently 4 levels one can set:
<p>
<ul>
<li>SVC - Disk Service Time</li>
<li>IOS - Number of Disk I/O Operations</li>
<li>LusKBS - Lustre KBytes/Sec</li>
<li>LusReints - Lustre MDS Reint operations</li>
</ul>

Note that one can also specify <i>all</i> conditions must be met or
simply 1 must be met by adding a selection of AND (the default) or OR, respectively.
<p>
For example, to set the minimal SVC level to 50 and require both SVC and IOS
limits be reached,  simply add the switch <i>-l SVC:50</i>.  
To change both values and require only 1 be met, separate them with a
<i>hyphen</i> and be sure to include OR as one of the parameters such as
<i>-l SVC:50-IOS:10-OR</i>, noting that order is not important.
<p>
One should not confuse exceptions which are based on threshold values, with filters
which are based on the presence of explicit field values.
