<center><h1>Inode Monitoring</h1></center>
<p>
The name of this subsystem is a slight misnomer because in addition to monitoring inodes it
also monitors dentries as well.  The information being reported is quite self-explanatory 
and there should really be no mystery here.
<p>
However, it may be worth noting that while inspired by <i>sar -v</i> the information isn't
quite the same in case that's what you're expecting.  Sar also reports on the number
pseudo terminals and somehow that didn't seem to fit with the types of data collectl reports
and so was left out.
<p>
Another difference worth noting is that while both report the number of open files, actually
calling them allocated file handles, it was felt that this number all by itself wasn't providing
as much info as it could and so the percentage of the total has also been included in collectl's
output.
<p>
While I wanted to do the same with dentries, reporting the percentage of the max, I ran into 
a problem - <i>the number of unused cache entries is wrong</i>, or at least the definition is!
Rather than decrease as new directories are created it goes up, which makes no sense to me and
so trying to report it as a percentage doesn't seem to make any sense.  However, a closer 
investigation makes me think this is in fact tracking the slab objects named <i>dentry_cache</i>
which does increase as new directories are created.  However something still isn't quite right
because while close, the numbers aren't close enough.
<p>
Investigatation will continue, though at a lower priority.
If/when resolved it will be fixed/documented accordingly.
