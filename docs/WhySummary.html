<title>collectl - Why Summary</title>

<center><h1>Why would I monitor summary data?</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>

The answer to this question is fundamental to understanding system monitoring in general,
whether you're using collectl or some other utilities.  To really understand what your system is
actually doing you should be looking at individual disks, cpus or networks.  But in reality that's
often too much to keep track of unless of course you have a single-cpu/disk system.
<p>
Let's say you have multiple devices such as disks and the one you're interested in is
misbehaving and reading or writing too slowly.  Won't the total disk activity also be low?  Similary if
disk traffic is being reported high on a lightly loaded system won't this also jump out you by simply
looking at the total disk activity?  The same can be said about networks and most other subsystems for
which there is summary data and simply looking at the totals will often alert you to the fact that 
something is not right.  The key thing to keep in mind that you are looking at totals.
<p>
CPU monitoring can be a little tricker as these are reported as averages as opposed to totals
and as the number of cores increase so does the divisor of the calculation.  In most cases when you
have a system with excessive load, it will effect all CPUs and so will be very visible even as an average,
but in some cases it won't.  What if you have a 2 core system and see 
a CPU load of 45% when you're expecting a much lighter load?  Looking at individual CPUs you may see
one running at near zero load and the second at 90%.  Your only clue was that the 45% load was unexpected
and so you looked closer.  But what if you had a heavily loaded CPU on a 48 core system?  You'd never
even realize it.  In other words, just pay attention.
<p>
Stated slightly differently, summary data is often a starting point to help identify potential trouble ares
and from there you can determine if you need to dig deeper.
<p>
<b>So why brief data?</b>
<p>
It you have ever tried to look at multiple lines of different text and identify what was changing over
time you should already know the answer - it's really difficult!  For example, here's what collectl might
show for CPU, Disk and Network data:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl.pl --verbose

and that's only 2 samples!  Think about trying to watch level of detail changing every second and identifying
changes?  Extremely difficult if not impossible.  It might be a little easier to watch in top format which you
can get by including --home, but now you lose the previous records to compare the values to.
<p>
Now consider the fact that in many cases seeing network errors or disk merges or even the percentage of time
the CPU spent processing interrupts, while important, may not be when trying to identify anomalous behaviors.
And that's where brief mode comes in.  Here we are identifying those few nuggets of information which will
tell us whether or not things are functioning as expected such that we can display them all on the same line
and make it easier to spot change.  In fact, during the following run I did a <i>ping -f</i> and see how easy it is
to spot the network burst?

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
collectl

</pre>
</div class=terminal>

Now, if you think there is a network problem you can then run collectl in verbose or detail
mode and only look at network and not be distracted by other data.
<p>
In summary, just keep in mind that there is no single recipe for how to monitor a system, what format to
display the output in and how to drill deeper.  However, as you become more familiar with the types of data
and collectl formats your ability to better utilize collectl will increase.
