<center><h1>Interrupts</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Prior to V2.5.0, collectl reported the total number of interrupts across all CPUs
as part of the CPU summary data and nothing about interrupts in the CPU detail.  
Since interrupt counts are actually reported in the kernel for each CPU 
by individual interrupt number, that information will now be made available both
in summary and detail formats.
However, a slightly different methodology for categorization will be used because
interrupt summary data will be reportd by CPU and detailed interrupt data will 
break out the data by individual interrupts for each CPU.
<p>
<h3>Requesting Interrupt Statistics</h3>
Since <i>-si</i> has already been taken for reporting inode statistics, 
interrupt summary data should be requested using <i>-sj</i> and detail data using <i>-sJ</i>.  
Interrupts are also treated differently than other statistics in a couple of ways:
<ul>
<li>Rather than reporting a fixed number of fields like other summary data, the number
of fields are variable and equal to the number of CPUs</li>
<li>If one specifies -sCj one will NOT get a separate verbose format for the <i>Interrupt
Summary</i>, but rather will have those details included as part of the CPU detail report
as shown in the examples below.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>Plot Data and s-expressions</h3>
Although looking at interrupt data in <i>brief</i> or <i>verbose</i> fits quite well with
collectl's reporting methodology, it doesn't fit the <i>plot</i> and <i>s-expression</i> 
formats.  This is because both expect a fixed number of fields in for summary data and
a variable number of fields for detail data, indexed by a device number.  However, 
interrupt summary data is actually variable size based on the number of CPUs and the
detail data doesn't really fit with anything and so trying to do so will generate an error.
Therefore to report interrupt data in plot or s-sexpressions
you will be required to request CPU detail data as well since interrupts are reported
as part of that data.
<p>
<h3>Examples</h3>
The following examples only show interrupt data except where CPU data is required.  Any of
these reports can be extended to include other data types.
<p>
This first example shows the basic interrupt output displayed in <i>brief</i> mode on an 8 
processor system, with timestamps.  If you include --verbose you essentially get the same
display except with more significant digits for each interrupt.


<div class=terminal>
<pre>
[mjs]# ./collectl.pl -sj -oT
#         <-----------------Int----------------->
#Time     Cpu0 Cpu1 Cpu2 Cpu3 Cpu4 Cpu5 Cpu6 Cpu7
12:49:55  4828  16K 1000  16K   18  16K  16K    0
12:49:56  4804  16K 1000  16K    0  16K  16K    0
12:49:57  4811  16K 1000  16K   18  16K  16K    0
</pre>
</div>

<p>
As mentioned above, specifying -sCj is <i>special</i> as it takes the data for 2 separate
subsystems (CPU detail and interrupt summary) and combines them in a single display as 
shown for two sampling periods on a 4 processor system:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
[mjs]# ./collectl.pl -sCj -oT
# SINGLE CPU STATISTICS
#            CPU  USER NICE  SYS WAIT IRQ  SOFT STEAL IDLE INTRPT
14:36:12       0     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100     11
14:36:12       1     0    0    0    0    0    0     0   99    999
14:36:12       2     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100      0
14:36:12       3     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100      0
14:36:13       0     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100     13
14:36:13       1     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100   1000
14:36:13       2     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100      0
14:36:13       3     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100      0
</pre>
</div>

A third form that can be particulary useful is the <i>Interrupt Details</i> which shows
the distribution of the individual interrupts across the CPUs.  What makes this form
especially handy is it only shows those interrupts that changed during the
monitoring cycle which is considerable easier to read than /proc/interrupts itself.

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
If the number of CPUs change during processing, this can only be detected when monitoring CPU data
at the same time.  If you are only monitoring interrupt data and there is a state change things will
get very messy.  As users typically monitor Interrupts and CPU data at the same time it is not
felt to be worth the extra effort or processng overhead to try and accommodate this rare case.
