<center><h1>Memory Fragmentation</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Version 3.2.1 of collectl introduces support for <i>/proc/buddyinfo</i>, which shows the distribution
of memory fragments where the size of each fragment is a power of 2 pages.  The memory is categorized
by node, depending on the system architecture and then subcategorized by the type of memory, referred
as a zone.  For example, the <i>/proc/buddyinfo</i> might look like:

<div class=terminal><pre>
Node 0, zone      DMA      5      5      3      4      2      4      3      1      0      0      0
Node 0, zone    DMA32     79     61      4     12      0      0      0      2      0      1      0
Node 1, zone    DMA32    134     57     27     60      0      0      1      1      0      1      0
Node 2, zone   Normal    865    357     37      1      6      0      2      1      0      1      0
Node 3, zone   Normal    651     47     19     10      1      1      1      1      0      1      0
</pre></div>

Running collectl with <i>-sb --verbose</i> would produce a single line of output that shows he totals
of each column.  For example, taking 1 second samples with timestamps included:

<div class=terminal><pre>
collectl -sb --verbose -oT
# MEMORY FRAGMENTATION SUMMARY (4K pages)
#                1       2       4       8      16      32      64     128     256     512    1024
16:11:26      1296     483     157      85       9       5       7       6       0       4       0
16:11:27      1354     485     163      87       9       5       7       6       0       4       0
16:11:28      1395     480     165      89       9       5       7       6       0       4       0
</pre></div>

And in detail mode we see one line per entry, again with timestamps:

<div class=terminal-wide14><pre>
collectl -sB -oT
# MEMORY FRAGMENTATION (4K pages)
#         Node    Zone        1       2       4       8      16      32      64     128     256     512    1024
16:13:33     0     DMA        5       5       3       4       2       4       3       1       0       0       0
16:13:33     0   DMA32      175      97       3      12       0       0       0       2       0       1       0
16:13:33     1   DMA32      933     389      60      68       0       0       1       1       0       1       0
16:13:33     2  Normal        0       1       8       1       6       0       2       1       0       1       0
16:13:33     3  Normal        1       2      57      10       1       1       1       1       0       1       0

Where things get interesting is in <i>brief</i> mode.  The challege here is to show the maximum amount of
information in the least amount of space, thus allowing you to look at other information on the same line
as well.  To better understand the methodology chosen for this, think in terms of <i>base 36</i>.
However, instead of mapping each character to a number from 0 to 35, we're going to do something very
different.  Since we're mainly interested in seeing what's happening as the numbers of fragments shrink:

<ul>
<li>map the 0 through 9 to the characters 0 through 9</li>
<li>map the numbers 10-99 to the characters <i>a</i> through <i>i</i> by dividing these values by 10</li>
<li>fragments in the range of 100-999 will be divided by 100 and mapped to the letters <i>j</i> through r</i></li>
<li>this only leaves us with the 8 letters <i>s</i> though <i>z</i> and being the coarsest
will be mapped to powers of 10 by essentially dividing the value by 1000 and taking the log10() of it</li>
</ul>

This results in a display like the following:

<div class=terminal><pre>
collectl -sb -oT
#         <---Memory-->
#Time        Fragments
16:24:13   qmji9576040
16:24:14   rmji9576040
16:24:15   smji9576040
16:24:16   smji9576040
16:24:17   rmji9576040
</pre></div>

As a final example of what this looks like when combined with other data, remembering you can chose
virtually any combination of subsystem for your display both in collection and playback modes:

<div class=terminal-wide14><pre>
collectl -sbcmn -oT
#         <--------CPU--------><------------------Memory-----------------><----------Network---------->
#Time     cpu sys inter  ctxsw Free Buff Cach Inac Slab  Map    Fragments   KBIn  PktIn  KBOut  PktOut
