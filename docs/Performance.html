<center><h1>Performance</h1></center>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
When thinking about the performance of collectl keep in mind that efficiency is one 
of the main design principles and it should therefore be possible to run collectl 
as a daemon on most systems with little concern for the overhead it generates.  
However, given that the another design principal it to be able to collect a very broad
and deep set of data, it is worth understanding a little more about just what goes on
in collectl.
<p>
During the earlier days of collectl development a third design consideration was
minimizing the amount of storage used for <i>raw</i> files.  At the time
disks were smaller and the amount of data collected was small enough that being more
judicious about what was saved felt like it made a difference.  However, since the 
inclusion of process, slab and now interrupt data along with larger disks the amount
of storage used has become less of a consideration.  In other words don't spend extra
data collection cycles trying to be more selective about what is recorded if it's
going to add to the overhead.
<p>
<h3>Measuring the Overhead</h3>
If you take a closer look at the <a href=Architecture.html>architecture</a> you can
see that the path of minimal overhead is when collectl reads from /proc and write
it to a file.  This is not an accident!  In fact, on many system this has been 
observed to take less than 0.1% of the CPU and this is when collecting almost 
all the data collectl is capable of.
However, this also raises several important questions for consideration:
<ul>
<li>What is the overhead on a specific system?</li>
<li>Is there a way to reduce the overhead further?</li>
<li>Is collection overhead for all data types the same and if not, what is it?</li>
</ul>
In fact, these are the very questions I asked during the initial development as well as
every time I add support for new data types.  In order to be able to answer these questions
quantitatively, collectl should be run with a collection interval of 0 and told to collect
8640 samples, the number of 10-second samples in a day.  By timing the execution you can 
then get a reasonable estimate of the daily overhead.  Consider the following:

<pre>
# time collectl -scdnm -i0 -c8640 -f /tmp
real    0m9.711s
user    0m7.480s
sys     0m2.140s
</pre>

and you can see that collectl uses about 10 seconds out of 86400 or about 0.01% of the cpu
to collect cpu, disk, network and memory data.  If we repeat the test again for just cpu
the time drops to under 4 seconds, so you can see if performance is really critical, you
can improve things by recording less data or maybe just do it less frequently.  The point
is these are tradeoffs only you can make if you feel collectl is using too much resource.
<p>
So what happens if you take a different processing path and save collectl data in plot
format?  This means adding the additional overhead of parsing the /proc data and performing
some basic math of the values.  If we use the same command as above and include -P:

<pre>
# time collectl -scdnm -i0 -c8640 -f /tmp
real    0m20.607s
user    0m17.970s
sys     0m2.580s
</pre>

we can see that this takes a little over twice as much overhead even though it is 
still pretty low.
<p>
One other example is worth mentioning and that is measuring process monitoring overhead,
which is probably the highest overhead operation collectl can do and one of the reasons
it has its own monitoring interval.  The overheard for collection of this type of data can
vary quite broadly depending on how may processes are running at the time and on a 
system with only 138 processes look at this:

<pre>
# time ./collectl.pl -sZ -i0 -c8640 -f /tmp
real    1m8.453s
user    0m54.650s
sys     0m13.430s
</pre>

noting collectl is also smart enough to only look at 1/6 as many processes since that
is the default relationship of process monitoring to other subsystem data.  This also
leads to the mention of a way to further optimize process monitoring.  
If you are monitoring a specify
set of processes, say <i>http</i> daemons, collectl no longer has to look at as much data 
in /proc and so we now see:

<pre>
# time ./collectl.pl -sZ -Zchttp -i0 -c8640 -f /tmp
real    0m5.721s
user    0m4.480s
sys     0m1.180s
</pre>

In fact, if we know there are never going to be any new http process appearing
(collectl looks for new processes that match selection strings by default):

<pre>
# time ./collectl.pl -sZ -Zchttp -i0 -c8640 --procopts p  -f /tmp
real    0m5.080s
user    0m3.930s
sys     0m1.130s
</pre>

And things get even better.  In fact, you could even imaging monitoring these processes
at the same interval as everything else with almost no additional overheard!
<p>
The number of different combinations of switches one can measure far exceeds the scope
of this discussion - for example we haven't even talked about the pros/cons of
compression.  But in conclusion, the main thing to remember is collectl's overhead is 
already pretty low but if you're really concerned, measure it yourself and adjust accordingly.
