<p>
Getting started using collectl may seem a little challenging to the new user because
of its many options, but it shouldn't be.  After all, how many people simply run the
<i>top</i> command and don't even realize there are a rich set of options available?
In that same spirit, you can simply enter the <i>collectl</i> command and get a lot
of useful information, but you would also be losing out on a lot.  The intent of
this tutorial is to give you a better appreciation of what you can do with collectl
and hopefully encourage you to experiment with even more options than those described
below.

<h3>Measuring Disk Activity</h3>
For this first set of examples I'll be using Robin Miller's 
<a href=http://www.scsifaq.org/RMiller_Tools/index.html>dt</a> to write a large file
to /tmp using the command <i>dt of=/tmp/test limit=1g bs=1m disable=compare,verify dispose=keep</i> while running collectl in another window:

<div class=terminal>

Here we see a few things including a burst of cpu activity when the test first
starts as well as an I/O rate of about 30MB/sec which corresponds to what dt is
telling us in the following summary line:

<pre>
Average transfer rates: 32051995 bytes/sec, 31300.776 Kbytes/sec
</pre>

If we compare the write rates to the number of writes we can also infer writes 
of about 128KB which is good to know because that means we're being efficient 
in the size of the data blocks being handed to the driver.  However if we don't
mind using the extra columns, we can include <i>--iosize</i>, which tells
collectl to include the average I/O size when using this default display format
also known as brief mode.  In <i>verbose</i> mode the I/O sizes are always included.

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
#<--------CPU--------><---------------Disks---------------->
#cpu sys inter  ctxsw KBRead  Reads Size KBWrit Writes Size
   9   8   381     71      0      0    0  30644    276  111
  14  13   325     85      0      0    0  32888    258  127
  11  10   313     80      0      0    0  31064    261  119
  12  11   421    186      0      0    0  32376    276  117
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This may also be a good time to mention screen real estate.  There is a lot of information
that collectl can display and everything takes space!  More often than not you don't 
really care about time and so by default it isn't displayed.  However there may be times
you do care and so you can simply add the switch -oT add the option of time to the display.
In fact, sometimes you may want to include the date as well in which case -oD will do
both.  You can even show the times in msec by including <i>m</i> with -o, which can be
useful when running at sub-second monitoring levels and/or if you want to correlate data
to system or application logs with may themselves have finer grained time.
Here's an example of the command <i>collectl -scd -i.25 -oDm</i>
which shows the cpu and disk loads every quarter second and includes the date and time in msecs:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
#                      <--------CPU--------><----------Disks----------->
#Date    Time          cpu sys inter  ctxsw KBRead  Reads KBWrit Writes
20080212 11:22:47.008    2   0   364     84      0      0  31328    284

20080212 11:22:47.508    8   6   308     84      0      0  36256    268
20080212 11:22:47.758    2   0   292     44      0      0  31152    196
</pre>
</div>

<p>
So what about that CPU load?  Given that this is a 2 CPU system we might be
interested in seeing how that load is being distributed by running the command
<i>collectl -sC</i>, since an uppercase subsystem type, like cpu, disk
or network tells collectl to show instance level details:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
# SINGLE CPU STATISTICS
#   CPU  USER NICE  SYS WAIT IRQ  SOFT STEAL IDLE
      0     0    0   17    0    0    0     0   83
      1     0    0    4    0    0    0     0   96
      0     0    0   14    0    0    0     0   86
      1     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100
      0     0    0   20    0    0    0     0   80
      1     0    0    0    0    0    0     0  100
</pre>
</div>

noting all the load is being delivered by a single CPU as expected.  Ok, so now
let's read back the 1G file we just wrote and see what happens.

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
#<--------CPU--------><----------Disks-----------><----------Network---------->
#cpu sys inter  ctxsw KBRead  Reads KBWrit Writes netKBi pkt-in netKBo pkt-out
  38  37   248    189   7283    111      0      0      1      9      1       8
  24  23   153     81     32      0      0      0      2     32      1       9
</pre>
</div>

Now we see a big burst of CPU load and not much from disk.  Furthermore dt
is reporting

<pre>
Average transfer rates: 872960833 bytes/sec, 852500.813 Kbytes/sec
</pre>

which in fact confirms that reads are coming from cache and not disk since
no local disk can read at this rate!  In general, when doing disk I/O testing one
should use file sizes that are larger than cache to force all I/O to come 
from disk.  So repeating the tests with a larger file we now see more 
realistic read rates:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
#<--------CPU--------><----------Disks-----------><----------Network---------->
#cpu sys inter  ctxsw KBRead  Reads KBWrit Writes netKBi pkt-in netKBo pkt-out
   9   8   773    743  41376    629      0      0      1      8      1       7
   9   8   619    639  31716    476      0      0      2     33      1       8
  16  15   510    554  23016    370      0      0      0      4      0       2
  10  10   572    624  27272    429      0      0      2     27      1       8
  16  15   458    504  19560    306     12      2      0      4      0       2
</pre>
</div>

So just what is happening to cache during testing?  To see memory utilization
we can simply add the memory subsystem to the default selections as
<i>collectl -s+m</i> but that also makes the display wider and since for our 
purposes we don't need network information I'm just going to run the following
<i>collectl -scmd</i>:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
#<--------CPU--------><-----------Memory----------><----------Disks----------->
#cpu sys inter  ctxsw free buff cach inac slab  map KBRead  Reads KBWrit Writes
   3   0   159     80   2G 395M 189M   1M    0    0      0      0     20      3
   1   0   153     52   2G 395M 189M   1M    0    0      0      0      0      0

   6   6   377     59   1G 395M 455M 266M    0    0      0      0  30900    266
  10  10   347     55   1G 395M 492M 303M    0    0      0      0  35004    265
   5   4   389     60   1G 395M 506M 318M    0    0      0      0  27308    262
</pre>
</div>

and watch the cache fill up.  In fact, if we keep running collectl eventually
we use up all available memory (but that's what it's there for) and even after
the test completes and there is no more I/O, we still see hardly any free
memory.  But that too is ok because until someone else needs it or deletes
the file, that data stays in cache.  Look at the last sample where I manually
deleted the file.  You can see the cache drop to 204M and the free memory 
rise to 2G during a single reporting interval:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
#<--------CPU--------><-----------Memory----------><----------Disks----------->
#cpu sys inter  ctxsw free buff cach inac slab  map KBRead  Reads KBWrit Writes

</pre>
</div>

For one more test, I'm going to write that same 1G file to my home directory and
look what collectl tells me:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
#<--------CPU--------><----------Disks-----------><----------Network---------->
#cpu sys inter  ctxsw KBRead  Reads KBWrit Writes netKBi pkt-in netKBo pkt-out
   0   0   145     48      0      0      0      0      2     38      2      13
  13  13  6716   3491      0      0      0      0    136    682  21144   14762
  18  18  6802   3426      0      0      0      0    248   1256  39111   27278
  14  14  4680   2420      0      0     28      2    252   1256  40166   28008

</pre>
</div>

Since my home directory is mounted via nfs, all I/O goes through the network!  In
fact, if I run collectl as <i>collectl -scfn</i> I see:

<div class=terminal>
<pre>
#<--------CPU--------><----------Network----------><------NFS Totals------>
#cpu sys inter  ctxsw   KBIn  PktIn  KBOut  PktOut   read  write meta comm
  19  19  1672    429      1     11      2      12      0   3885    6    0
  27  27  8466  12909   1652  20875  56112   39495      0  19383    0    4
   9   9  4042   1632    301   3781  10125    7129      0   9508    0    0
   7   7 18677   9074   3557  44897 120375   84729      0      0    0    0
   8   8 18082   8874   3559  44928 120359   84717      0      0    0    0
</pre>
</div>

I first see a batch of over 3K nfs writes which also include 6 metadata calls,
which are clearly doing a variety of directory accesses to see if the file
currently exists as well as for creating the new one.  During the next 
interval the network starts sending the bulk of the data over the network,
which also include 4 commits (nfs does commits for a batch of writes as 
opposed to a single commit/write which would be excessive and slow).  In
the intervals that follow, nfs need do no more writes as they've already been
queued up and so for the next several intervals all we see is the network
traffic.  The CPU load has also gone down because the data has already been
moved into the outbound I/O buffers.  For more details on nfs, see <a href=NfsInfo.html>
this</a> page.
<p>
So in conclusion you can see there is really quite a lot you can do with just a few basic
switches and I haven't even gotten into <i>--verbose</i>, which as they say is an exercise left for
the student.  So try some simple dt tests yourself or use you own personal favorite
load generator, while trying out <i>collectl -sc --verbose</i> or <i>collectl -sm --verbose</i> or even
<i>collectl -sn --verbose</i>.  You can even put them all together as 
<i>collectl -scmn --verbose</i>, but then as you'll see you end up using a lot of that valuable
screen real estate.  As a final bonus, try adding the --home switch which move the cursor to the
home (upper left-hand corner) position of the screen.  Think of this as something like the
linux <i>top</i> command (collectl also has a --top switch for displaying slab/process data)
since each sample is displayed at the top of the screen.  That command
would then look like <i>collectl -smcn --verbose --home</i>.
