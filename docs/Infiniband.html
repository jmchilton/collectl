<h3>Monitoring</h3>
The most important thing you should know about Infiniband monitoring is that it
is <i>destructive</i>.  What is meant by this is that every time 
collectl reads the counters from the HCA it immediately resets them to zero, thereby 
<i>destroying</i> their previous contents.  You should also note this does 
<i>not</i> apply error counters, which are never reset.
<p>
The obvious question is <i>why?</i> and perhaps the less than obvious answer is
because when the hardware specifications were written for the Infiniband HCAs it
was decided that performance counters would not wrap, probably because nobody
thought someone might want to do continuous sampling.  In any event, at even modest
traffic rates HCAs with 32-bit counters quickly reach their maximum values and
stop incrementing, rendering them useless for performance monitors like collectl.
Collectl's solution to this problem is to read the
counters and immediately reset them to 0.  As long as the next sampling period occurs
before the counters <i>fill up</i>, this methodology comes reasonably close to 
reflecting the traffic rates (some counts are lost between the read and reset).
<p>
However, this methodology has a downside in that while collectl is monitoring
the Infiniband stats, nobody else can (including other copies of collectl).
Unfortunately there is no solution to this problem short of redesigning the HCA
and that's simply not going to happen.  A second alternative would be to come
up with a mechanism in which the read/rest of the counters are moved into an OFED
module which exports these to /proc or /sys as rolling counters.  This was in 
fact done in a pre-ofed version of Voltaire's IB stack which is currently supported
by collectl.  If someone would like to hear more details on how this was done, feel
free to contact me or to post something in a collectl
<a href=http://sourceforge.net/forum/?group_id=196536>forum</a> or to the 
<a href=http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=196536>mailing list</a>.
<p>
If you want to run collectl but also prevent it from doing destructive monitoring,
simple comment out the line in <i>/etc/collectl.conf</i> that begins with
<i>PQuery =</i> and you will be informed by collectl that Infiniband monitoring
has been disabled whenever someone try to monitor it.
<p>
<h3>Monitoring Mechanics</h3>
The main purpose of this section is to help you understand how monitoring works so when
it doesn't you might be able to figure out what went wrong.  There are 2 different ways
collectl can monitor Infiniband, one for the OFED stack, which is the Infiniband Stack 
of choice these days and the other for pre-OFED.
<p>
<b>OFED</b>
<p>
The OFED stack can be identified by the presence of the <i>/sys/class/infiniband</i>
directory.  If there, collectl looks inside to find which HCAs are present and which
ports are active.  This information is then used to query the HCA via the <i>perfquery</i>
utility.
<p>
Unfortunately, with each release of OFED that utility seems to move to another location
and collectl tries to react by using a search path in /etc/collectl.conf.  As of the 2.5.1
release of collectl, if it still can't find the utility it will try to find its location
with rpm and then add its path to collectl.conf.  If a future OFED release eliminates or
replaces perfquery collectl will break.
<p>
<b>Pre-OFED</b>
<p>
If it is determined the OFED stack is not running, collectl will try to use the
<i>get_pcounter</i> utility to query the HCA, which is in fact what 
<i>perfquery</i> is based on.  Since this utility has also moved around during
various releases, it too has a search list in collectl.conf, but unlike perfquery
if it can't be found no additional heroics will be attempted to find it.  If you
don't have this utility on your system (and even if you do) you should probably 
consider moving to OFED.
<p>
<b>Debugging</b>
<p>
Collectl has a variety of debugging capabilities built into it, the main one being
the debug switch -d.  To use this switch you specify a bit mask which is then applied
against a variety settings which tells collectl what to display.  For
debugging interconnect problems simply use -d2.  All possible bit settings
and their meanings are listed in the beginning of collectl itself.
<p>
If collectl runs without errors but you're not seeing IB traffic being reported
when you think you should, you can always use -d4 or even -d6, which show
the values of the counters returned by both perfquery and get_pcounter.  If they
don't change something outside of collectl must be wrong.
<p>
One example of a non-collectl problem was a system had IB configured and started
which could be verified by seein an <i>ib0</i> interface show up with <i>ifconfig</i>.
However, when
running <i>collectl -sN</i>, which will show the traffic over all the network
interfaces, there was never any traffic on the <i>ib</i> interface however there
was unexpected traffic on one of the <i>eth</i> interfaces.  Clearly something 
was wrong and looking at the routing showed the routes were set such that all 
traffic to the infiniband address was being routed over the <i>eth</i> interface.
